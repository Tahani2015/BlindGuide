# Team members : Tahani Almanie | Rsha Mirza | Zhihao Wu

Blind Guider is a wearable device implemented using the Arduino and aims to help blind people in three ways. 
  First: it detects the presence of obstacles in front of the user without the need of physical contact. 
  Second: it gives a flashing light to inform surrounding people to be aware of having a blind person. 
  Third: it includes a compass in order to guide the user to the main four directions. 
Some vibration will be provided as an indicator of detecting an object in front of the user and also to indicate 
the required direction.
It contains three different operating modes; safety mode to detect the obstacles and give the flashing light, compass 
mode to guide the user to the main directions and the off mode.
